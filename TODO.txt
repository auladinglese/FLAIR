Although it gives us a good idea of how much time each component needs,
I agree that we might want to move the �Processing�� message somewhere else
(where it won�t interfere with the user scrolling through results)
and show the Bing results before extracting and parsing the documents.
Does it make sense to you?

I suggest keeping the numbers in FLAIR_Redux for debugging
and deploy the numberless final version as FLAIR (which we�ll make public).

Could you please look into this issue?
If you can�t replicate it, don�t spend too much time on it though.

:)


Design issues (I�ll look into it later):

>  items).
+

> - A small button "About FLAIR" (on top right of page?) is missing - it

The first prototype had a slightly different design.
I�ll discuss it with Detmar.

it seems to me that the best way to communicate the information
between teachers and students is the following: The teacher configures
the system the way (s)he wants it, and then generates a link that
(s)he can send out for the students to use the sytem. I.e. the URL 
contains the relevant settings. 

In every other setup I can imagine, one would instead have to allow
the teachers to change FLAIR (e.g. save settings files on the server)
or to establish who is the teacher and who his/her students are, etc.
