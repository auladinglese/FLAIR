# FLAIR (Form-Focused Linguistically Aware Information Retrieval)
## (Now with automatic question generation!)

FLAIR is an online tool for language teachers and learners that:
* searches the web for a topic of interest
* analyzes the results for grammatical constructions and readability levels
* re-ranks the results according to your (pedagogical or learning) needs specified in the settings

This fork of FLAIR additionally supports the automatic generation of factual (reading comprehension) questions from the contents of the results.

Built using the [Google Web Toolkit](http://www.gwtproject.org/) and [Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/).
